# Explore Weather Trends

### Summary

This project is a practice of SQL and data analysis. The project analyzes the local temperature data and the global temperature data and compares the temperature trends.
Â 
* Steps taken in the project:
* Data was extracted from the database using SQL.
* Total temperature averages, maximums and minima were extracted from the database using SQL.
* The data extracted from the database was imported into Google documents.
* A line chart was created to perform the analysis of the data. And two moving averages were made to have a better temperature display. The first was grouped in 10 years and the second in 20 years.



### Observations

* The average temperature in the city where I live in Memphis is hotter than the average global temperature.
* The average temperature in Memphis has not been constant have a tendency to go up slowly and with a sharp drop around 1820.
* The changes observed in the temperature of my city compared to the changes in the global temperature have similarities both have a temperature drop for the same dates and the two present a tendency to raise their temperature.
* The trend in the last 100 years is towards high, reaching temperatures never before seen in previous years, this is observed in both local and global temperatures.
